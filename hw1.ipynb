    "### About this assignment:\n",
    "The main purpose of this assignment is to check whether your programming knowledge is adequate to take CPSC 330. This assignment covers two python packages, `numpy` and `pandas`, which we'll be using throughout the course. For some of you, Python/numpy/pandas will be familiar; for others, it will be new. Either way, if you find this assignment very difficult then that could be a sign that you will struggle later on in the course. While CPSC 330 is a machine learning course rather than a programming course, programming will be an essential part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, as part of this assignment you will likely need to consult the documentation for various Python packages we're using. This is, of course, totally OK and in fact strongly encouraged. Reading and interpreting documentation is an important skill, and in fact is one of the skills this assignment is meant to assess. That said, do not use Large Language Model tools such as ChatGPT to complete your assignment; it would be self-deceptive and by doing so you will only be hurting your own learning, especially in this assignment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For Python refresher, check out [Python notes](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/docs/python-notes) and [Python resources](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/docs/resources#python-resources)."

    "\n",
    "In order to do this assignment and future assignments, you will need to set up the CPSC 330 software stack, which is Python and Jupyter. For software install help, see [here](https://ubc-cs.github.io/cpsc330-2025W2/docs/setup). Once you have the software stack installed, you should be able to run the next cell, which imports some packages needed for the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the software stack can be frustrating and challenging. But remember that it is an integral part of becoming a data scientist or machine learning engineer. This is going to be a valuable skill for your future self. Make the most of the tutorials available this week, as the TAs are ready to assist you with the setup. "

    "1. **Run all cells before submitting:** Go to `Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs`, then select `Run -> Run All Cells`. This ensures your notebook runs cleanly from start to finish without errors.  \n",

    "   - Upload only your `.ipynb` file **with outputs displayed** and any required output files.  \n",
    "   - Do **not** submit other files from your repository.  \n",
    "   - If you need help, see the [Gradescope Student Guide](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/gradescope-student-guide/).  \n",
    "3. **Check that outputs render properly.**  \n",
    "   - Make sure all plots and outputs appear in your submission.  \n",
    "   - If your `.ipynb` file is too large and doesn't render on Gradescope, also upload a PDF or HTML version so the TAs can view your work.  \n",
    "4. **Keep execution order clean.**  \n",
    "   - Execution numbers must start at \"1\" and increase in order.  \n",
    "   - Notebooks without visible outputs may not be graded.  \n",
    "   - Out-of-order or missing execution numbers may result in mark deductions.  \n",
